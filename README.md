# Website at lexeme78557.github.io

This is a personal website using Jekyll to help host some interactive data visualizations. There are also some blog posts on randomly selected deep learning topics.

## Sources

This is an amalgamation of [portfolYOU](https://github.com/YoussefRaafatNasry/portfolYOU) and [4dcu.be](https://github.com/4dcu-be/4dcu.be).

[portfolYOU](https://github.com/YoussefRaafatNasry/portfolYOU) was used for:
 * overall style, taking off a few elements -- Blog, About, Projects all are included here
 * also progress bars for skills are modified to contain words, not percentages
 
[4dcu.be](https://github.com/4dcu-be/4dcu.be)
 * vega-lite additions -- found in the `_plugins` folder and the vega-added things in `assets/js`

NOTE!!! it is quite likely that you have to serve the site locally and/or delete _site before pushing for your changes to go live.  I AM NOT SURE.  Have to re-start after you do a change to the config.yml file
